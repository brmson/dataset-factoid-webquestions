Freebase Relation Paths
=======================

This specific dataset records a set of relation paths that connect
the key Freebase concept with some answer of the respective question.
The dataset contains an attribute **freebaseRelPaths**, which is
a list of path objects; each path object is represented by an
array-stored tuple of

	[path, nMatches]

with **path** being a list of strings with relation names and
**nMatches** being number of answer matches within this path.

This data has been generated by ``scripts/freebase_relpaths_g.py``
from the Freebase Google API.  Similar data could be generated
from the RDF dump using ``scripts/feedbase_relpaths.py`` if you
have a fast enough triple store.
